schematic and programmers reference manual for the ARM processor
on the raspberry pi.  Also find information on how to load and run
these programs.

This is similar to the uart## examples except it uses the full blown
uart not the mini uart.  UART0 instead of UART1.  Same gpio pins are
used, different alternate gpio functions.  uart clock is 3000000HZ.

It spits out a bunch of stuff then goes into an echo loop.

See the top level README file for information on how to connect the
raspi uart to your host computer.

Using a dumb terminal (minicom) 115200 board No parity 8 bits 1 stop
bit, no flow control (might have to exit minicom and start again for
the flow control setting to take).  What you type on the dumb terminal
comes back.
